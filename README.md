This repository contains a web-based project that was developed during the fourth year of my five-year undergraduate program as part of my coursework. It displays product information from supermarkets across the city of Patras, providing users with an interactive map loaded with relevant data. Built with MySQL, PHP, Python, and CSS, this application enables users to log in and access a map interface that visualizes supermarket product information for efficient browsing. The backend utilizes MySQL for data storage and management, while PHP and Python handle data processing and serve content dynamically. CSS is used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless experience as users navigate product details on the map.
